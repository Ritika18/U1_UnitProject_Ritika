<h1>The Blizzard Snake</h1>

<h1>By: Ritika Kacholia</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This game is a variation of the snake game. Similar to the snake game, the object here is to collect the red circles with only the 
blue square. Every time you collect a circle, it adds another square to the blizzard making it more and more difficult to effectively 
capture the red circles. The game uses the following keys = 'a', 's', 'd', and 'w'. Let, down, right, and up respectively.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>My inspiration for this game came for my interest in the snake game. It's a game which I like so I thought I would try to recreate a version of it.</p>
